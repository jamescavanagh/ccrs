# Chinese Characters Relationship System 

It goes without saying that Chinese characters are a completely different system of writing than of Indo-European languages. As a westerner, used to alphabets that associate letters with sounds, it is hard to imagine another way of organizing language and thought. This project has nothing to do with spoken Chinese, but instead only deals with written Chinese which I believe is a completely different problem than learning spoken Chinese.

Chinese can be likened to looking at a map. A child, staring over a map, one will see a complex jumble of roads, topography, and names. Yet, an adult, will quickly chunk and categorize the map according to patterns, seeing trails, roads, mountains and water features to quickly digest the information in the map. Without knowing how to read a map, Chinese characters look like a gnarled hodgepodge of strokes, slashes and dots that gives one a headache to look at. 

Yet, once a learner understands the patterns and logic, some advantages begin to come to the surface due to the fact that Chinese characters contain more information than alphabetic letters. This can be liked to how a grandmasters can memorize chess board positions with incredible accuracy. A grandmaster sees patterns and themes, while a novice sees a jumble of pieces. 

Understanding these patterns with a deliberate and concerted effort is key to efficient aquisition of written Chinese. Adults do not have the time that Chinese schoolchildren do to learn by rote. Here, I would like to explain my method of learning by relationships.

In order to unlock the rich understanding, we have to consider the following.

## 1. Idiographic Relationship between words that share common characters 

Just like how English has Greek and Latin Roots, if you learn a word root, you can infer the meaning of other words. 

## 2. Relationship between similar characters with the same pronuciation

Chinese characters often give clues to how it is pronounced on the left side. These words will have a different meaning because of the idiogram, but are related  nonetheless by the shared pronunciation.

## 3. Structure and Logic of Character Composition

This is critical to reading Chinese which is not taught well enough since it is done unconciously and effortlessly by native speakers. There is a method to the madness of how Chinese characters are constructed. They should be read like a map, in the same way every time. Understanding this structure leads to chunking and ease of remembering them compared to writing them over and over again to memorize theme. When I read a Chinese character, I see 2 or 3 chunks rather than a dozen strokes.

## 4. Relationship between Character Components (Radicals)

This is the lowest level of Chinese characters. As a result, it doesn't have the strongest associations, but understanding or considering why a character has certain idiographs will lead to better memory and recall.

## 5. Relationship to personal experience

Relating words to personal experience is why language immersion is so effective. I can order coffee in several East Asian languages, since I need coffee in the morning, my brain recognizes the importance of remembering the words. However, I don't want to use this as a primary method to remember words, since it is not deliberate. Instead, this should be used at a higher level to guide the direction of vocabulary aquisition.

## 6. Relationship to deep Chinese Culture (Idioms and allusions)

   At a final level, Chinese characters have a relationship to the culture itself. While Chinese and English share a suprising amount of idioms, such as how in English you say "Kill two birds with one stone," in Chinese it is "Shoot two birds with one arrow." There are many allusions to Chinese culture, which can become very interesting and engender curiousity. This is the final level of relationships that I use to learn.
